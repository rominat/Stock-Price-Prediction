# Stock-Price-Prediction using LSTM

The project involves importing stock market data of 5 years for The Coca-Cola Company ( ticker symbol KO) from Yahoo Finance, preprocessing it, building an LSTM model using Keras, training the model, and then using it to predict future stock prices. The effectiveness of the model is demonstrated by comparing the predicted prices with actual prices using visualization techniques

## Motivation: 
The Coca-Cola Company is a beverage corporation that produces, advertises, and distributes a variety of nonalcoholic drinks. Its global presence drove me to look at the historical data of their stock prices.

## Why Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)?
LSTM is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). RNNs are great at capturing long term dependecies in sequential data and that makes them a great choice for time-series data, such as natural language processing, speech recognition, and, as in this case, stock market prediction.
